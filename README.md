# StockBuddy

StockBuddy is an idea I came up with at a previous job in restaurant management. Like many establishments, we used old-fashioned pen and paper to track our inventory and create ordering lists. I thought it would be much easier to handle these operations with a simple ordering/inventory app.

# Getting Started

On the landing page you'll be able to sign up either as a vendor or a regular user. As a regular user, when logging in, you'll see a list of vendors that have registered with the app. You can click on a vendor in the list to view that vendor's store and add items to your cart and/or inventory list.
When logging in as a vendor, you'll be taken to a form to register your store information. Then you'll have access to your vendor dashboard, where you can edit your store info and add and remove items from your store. Regular users will be able to view your store and include items you add in their order and inventory lists.
